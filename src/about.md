This website is running on a computer I found on the side of the road. If stuff isn't working or being weird I'm probably messing with something. {.text}

My server's running NixOS and using Nginx for the website. The website's coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with a little bit of PHP. {.text}

I've also made some videos on [Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrLkMOV08B50cJFD2ocWdMA){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} {.text}

My sister has made some cool [animations.](https://youtube.com/channel/UCC8U-ZPoaPM55mHps171puA){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} {.text}
