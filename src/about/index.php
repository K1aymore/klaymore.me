      This website is running on a computer I found on the side of the road. If stuff isn't working or being weird I'm probably messing with something. Also my internet turns off from 21:50 to like 5:30.

      My server's running NixOS and using Nginx for the website. The website's coded in HTML, CSS, and PHP. <br />
